# osucollector-gui
GUI version of osucollector downloader (still nothing great tho..)

Just paste the id of the collection from https://osucollector.com/ (e.g <a href="https://osucollector.com/collections/1656">1656</a>) and it will download and import all the beatmaps from the collection

(Sometimes you need to press F5 when while playing osu! to refresh maps)
