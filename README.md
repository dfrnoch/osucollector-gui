# osucollector-gui
GUI version of osucollector downloader (still nothing great tho..)

Just paste the id of the collection from https://osucollector.com/ (e.g <a href="https://osucollector.com/collections/1656">1656</a>) and it will download and import all the beatmaps from the collection

(Sometimes you need to press F5 when while playing osu! to refresh maps)


This is supposed to be in the paid version of the osu collector, so I recommend supporting them
